# Mol_properties
A machine learning–based workflow for predicting molecular properties from SMILES. These scripts support preprocessing molecular fingerprints (e.g., SMILES), training predictive models, and evaluating performance metrics. It can be used for exploratory research, cheminformatics workflows, or as a foundation for QSAR model development.
